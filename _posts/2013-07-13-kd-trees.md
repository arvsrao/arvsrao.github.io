<p>Computational geometry is generally concerned with algorithms that solve problems that can be stated in purely geometric terms like: find the smallest polygon which encloses a set of points or construct a data structure to support efficient querying of a set of points. I once interviewed at company that relied on methods from this field. It was during an afternoon one-on-one interview that the k-d tree data structure came up. We, the interviewer and I, were discussing how to find the closest point in a point cloud. At the time, I struggled to find the answer (we were in bonus territory, anyway:)). He explained how one could create a data structure that partitioned the point space into finer and finer cells. And if one keeps track of the relationship between a cell and its constituents, then one can quickly search the space. Essentially, that is what a k-d tree does for point clouds.</p>

<p>k-D dimensional trees are data structures that allow for fast search and querying of point sets. These binary trees have nodes which are k-dimensional points. The tree organizes points by partitioning the point space along each coordinate axis.</p> <!--more-->

<p>Driven to understand this data structure, I coded up a C++ implementation, which you can see <a href="https://github.com/arvsrao/K-d-Tree">on github</a>. Looking at the code: <em>Kdtree</em> class (in kdtree.cpp) represents a k-d tree; main.cpp is essentially a test, that creates a k-d tree with ten randomly generated 3-d points.</p>

<pre><code>{8.40924, 4.11543, 8.10499}, 
{6.50689, 1.3663, 3.43026}, 
{9.7614, 9.8382, 0.672512}, 
{0.113181, 2.22785, 3.46726}, 
{5.23381, 4.69416, 4.74723}, 
{9.74655, 0.191659, 1.20641}, 
{2.8546, 7.32662, 8.51895}, 
{6.21829, 0.779546, 1.82988},

<p>So how does one go about making the tree? Well, we first have to determine which among the ten points will be the root. One could chose a point at random, but doing so won't necessarily yield a balanced tree. The algorithm procedes by recursively partitioning the points along each axis, which in our example are the <em>x,y,z - axes</em>. Beginning with the <em>x-axis</em>, the list of points is sorted with respect the the <em>x-axis</em>, where the median point is choosen to be the root (denote green in the figure below) Points with <em>x-values</em> less than root are then grouped into what I call the <em>left list</em>. Likewise, points with <em>x-values</em> greater than root are grouped into the <em>right list</em>. Each list represents new and smaller point clouds, which in turn are partitioned, but this time not along the x-axis, but the <em>y-axis</em>. Specificaly, the median with respect to the <em>y-axis</em>. The root's children are constructed from the lists' medians--the median of the <em>left list</em> becomes the left child, and the median of the <em>right list</em> becomes the right child.</p>

<p>And the process continues, recursively partition left and right lists, until such lists are empty. The figure below summarizes the first few partitions, and highlights the nodes created.</p>

The algorithm loosely described above in detail:</p>

<pre><code>void Kdtree::_makeTree( Node* head, std::list&lt;Kdtree::vecType&gt;&amp; plist, int depth )
{   
    if( !plist.empty() ) 
    {
        int k = plist.front().size();
        int axis = depth % k;

        std::list&lt;Kdtree::vecType&gt; left_list;
        std::list&lt;Kdtree::vecType&gt; right_list;
        Kdtree::vecType median = Kdtree::findMedian(axis, plist, left_list, right_list); 
        head-&gt;data = median;

        Node* left_node = new Node(k);
        Node* right_node = new Node(k);

        Kdtree::_makeTree( left_node, left_list, depth+1);
        if (!left_list.empty()) head-&gt;left = left_node;

        Kdtree::_makeTree( right_node, right_list, depth+1);
        if (!right_list.empty()) head-&gt;right = right_node;
    }
} 
</code></pre>

<p>One of the sweeter parts of this project was getting to use C++11 lambda expressions for median computation. Lambda functions are quick, small, anonymous functions that can be passed around, often as input to other functions. See <a href="http://www.cprogramming.com/c++11/c++11-lambda-closures.html">this write up</a> for more information about C++ lambdas. Check it out:</p>

<pre><code>// Using lambda function here, to define comparison function--parametrized by 'axis'
plist.sort( [&amp;](Kdtree::vecType&amp; a, Kdtree::vecType&amp; b){return a[axis] &lt; b[axis];});
</code></pre>

<p>Some background here: <em>std::list</em> has a method for sorting; it takes a comparator function. And in the new C++11 standard there's not need to define the necessary compare function elsewhere, you can instead pass a lambda function defining an ordering. The lambda function shown above is especially nice because it's parameterized by the variable <em>axis</em>, to which it has access, defining a different comparison function for each <em>axis</em>. Otherwise one would have to define separate compare functions for each <em>axis</em>; and where sorting is done and the compare functions are passed--as seen above, <em>plist.sort()</em>--calls for each <em>axis</em> would have to be defined in a switch statement. Lambda saved us a lot of extra coding! Super elegant!!</p>
