Awhile back I studied differential geometry and geometric analysis [@Iowa][3]. But these days I work with *the* big data [@HERE][1]. While I **left** academic mathematics, mathematics never *left* me. How I think about problem solving and my scientific tastes are heavily influenced by mathematics.

That said, I have broad interests which span pure and applied mathematics, electrical engineering, and computer science. In particular, topics related to graphics, geometry processing, computational geometry and topology; MIMO wireless system design and associated detection/estimation methods; and more...This blog is an attempt to record my musings on these and other topics.

I love discussions, so please don't hesitate to connect [@cwcomplex][2] or <span style="font-size:18px;font-family:american typewriter"> {first name} **at** {last name}.im</span>.
