# C++ Nanodegree

I really enjoyed working my way through Udacity's [C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). Each lesson culminated in a final project. My final project submissions are described below; all submissions are, of course, implemented in C++.

## Final Project Submissions

**Note**: *If interested in runnable code please follow the links in the project list below.*

- [System Monitor](https://github.com/arvsrao/CppND-System-Monitor): 
- [Memory Management - Chatbot](https://github.com/arvsrao/CppND-Memory-Management-Chatbot):  
- [Concurrent Traffic Simulation](https://github.com/arvsrao/CppND-Program-a-Concurrent-Traffic-Simulation):  
- [Capstone - Asteroids Game](https://github.com/arvsrao/Asteroids): I designed and wrote a 2D shooter game, from scratch. Out of interest I choose to make my own version of Asteroids. The player navigates a star field in the Starship Enterprise must defend against oncoming asteroids.
