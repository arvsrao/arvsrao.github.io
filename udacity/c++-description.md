# C++ Nanodegree

I really enjoyed working my way through Udacity's [C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). Each lesson culminated in a final project. My final project submissions are described below; all submissions are, of course, implemented in C++.

## Final Project Submissions

**Note**: *If interested in runnable code please follow the links in the project list below.*

* [OSM Route Planner](https://github.com/arvsrao/CppND-Route-Planning): Plot a path between two points on a map using real map data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). I implemented the core route finding logic, which is the `A*` algorithm. 

- [System Monitor](https://github.com/arvsrao/CppND-System-Monitor): The focus of this project was to practice object oriented principles (OOP). A system monitor is program that shows a real-time view of running processes on a computer. I used the `std` library to read and parse system files containing information about running processes. Classes are used to define and implement parsers and renderable entities, like processes.
- [Memory Management - Chatbot](https://github.com/arvsrao/CppND-Memory-Management-Chatbot): 
- [Concurrent Traffic Simulation](https://github.com/arvsrao/CppND-Program-a-Concurrent-Traffic-Simulation): I completed key portions of a *multithreaded* traffic simulator. Cars, intersections, and traffic lights are all simulated on separate threads. To prevent collisions I used promises and futures, condition variables, and message queues to ensure orderly queuing of cars at intersections and that cars waiting in an intersection for a green light are properly notified.
- [Capstone - Asteroids Game](https://github.com/arvsrao/Asteroids): I chose to make my own *multithreaded* version of Asteroids, the classic arcade game. The player must defend against oncoming asteroids as it navigates a star field in the Starship Enterprise. New asteroids are spawned at random times on a background thread. Also each asteroid manages a thread that detects collisions with the player ship and phaser blasts. The SDL library was used to detect user input and render images and text (like the score) to the screen.
